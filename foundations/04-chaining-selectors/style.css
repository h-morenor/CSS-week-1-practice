/* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `proportioned` 
classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it 
retains its original square proportions 
(don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted` 
classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big 
as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
